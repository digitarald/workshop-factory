MCP Dev Summit NYC – Speaker Prep 1‑Pager
=========================================

## Event overview

- **Event:** MCP Dev Summit North America (NYC)
- **Focus:** Model Context Protocol (MCP), open tooling, and ecosystem for AI agents and copilots.
- **Format:** 2‑day, single‑track keynotes plus multiple breakout tracks, lightning talks, and hallway unconference sessions.
- **Audience:** AI engineers, infra/platform teams, open‑source contributors, vendor/tooling partners, and technical decision‑makers.

## Objectives for speakers

- Show real, working MCP integrations and patterns, not just slideware.
- Share lessons learned: architecture, tradeoffs, failures, and what you’d do differently.
- Give attendees ideas they can take back and implement within 30–90 days.
- Connect your talk to the broader MCP ecosystem (interoperability, standards, and community).

## Program structure (typical)

- Morning: Keynotes and fireside chats on:
  - State of MCP and roadmap.
  - Large‑scale MCP deployments and reference architectures.
  - Security, governance, and enterprise adoption stories.
- Afternoon: Breakouts and deep dives:
  - MCP server and client implementations.
  - Tooling, SDKs, and frameworks.
  - Observability, evals, and safety.
  - Industry case studies (e.g., developer productivity, customer support, data workflows).
- Throughout:
  - Lightning talks and demos.
  - Birds‑of‑a‑feather / unconference sessions.
  - Sponsor demos and booths.

## Attendee profile

- Roles: Staff+ engineers, tech leads, platform and infra teams, startup founders, product/AI leads.
- Experience level: Comfortable with APIs, infra, and production systems; interested in concrete implementation details and code‑level patterns.
- Expectations from talks:
  - Clear, technical content (diagrams, APIs, workflows, benchmarks).
  - Honest discussion of limitations and open problems.
  - Minimal marketing; strong signal‑to‑noise ratio.
