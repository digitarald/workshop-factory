        title: What Is Agent Mode and Why It Matters
        duration: 3
        talking_points:
          - >-
            Agent Mode is a built-in feature of GitHub Copilot in VS Code — open
            the Chat panel (⌃⌘I / Ctrl+Alt+I) and select 'Agent' from the mode
            dropdown at the top.
          - >-
            Unlike regular Chat (which answers questions) or Inline Chat (which
            edits a single selection), Agent Mode can autonomously create, edit,
            and delete multiple files to complete a task.
          - >-
            Think of it as a pair programmer that can take action: it reads your
            project, proposes a plan, writes code, and even runs terminal
            commands — all from a single prompt.
          - >-
            Agent Mode works iteratively: it makes changes, checks for errors
            (lint, compile), and self-corrects without you having to re-prompt.
          - >-
            For static web projects (HTML, CSS, JS) this is especially powerful
            — the agent can scaffold an entire site structure in seconds.
          - >-
            Every change the agent proposes shows up as a diff you can review
            before accepting. You stay in control at all times.
          - >-
            Quick orientation: the mode picker (Agent / Chat / Edit) is at the
            top of the Chat panel. Make sure you see 'Agent' selected to follow
            along today.

        title: Where Would You Use an AI Agent in Your Workflow?
        duration: 3
        prompts:
          - >-
            Think about a repetitive task you do when starting a new web project
            — creating boilerplate HTML, linking a CSS file, adding meta tags.
            Would you trust an AI agent to handle that? Why or why not?
          - >-
            What's the difference between asking a search engine for help vs.
            asking an agent that can directly edit your files? What risks or
            benefits come to mind?
          - >-
            Have you ever copied code from a tutorial or Stack Overflow and had
            to adapt it to your project? How might an agent that already sees
            your project files do this differently?
          - >-
            Where would you draw the line — what tasks would you want to keep
            doing manually even if an agent could do them?

        title: Agent Mode Quick Check
        duration: 4
        questions:
          - How do you open Agent Mode in VS Code?
          - Name one key difference between Agent Mode and regular Copilot Chat.
          - >-
            True or false: Agent Mode applies all changes to your files
            automatically without showing you what changed.
        expected_answers:
          - >-
            Open the Chat panel (⌃⌘I / Ctrl+Alt+I) and select 'Agent' from the
            mode dropdown at the top.
          - >-
            Agent Mode can autonomously create, edit, and delete multiple files,
            while regular Chat only provides text responses and code suggestions
            you must manually apply.
          - >-
            False. Agent Mode shows proposed changes as diffs that you review
            and accept or reject before they are applied.
        explanations:
          - >-
            The Chat panel is your entry point for all Copilot interactions. The
            mode dropdown at the top lets you switch between Chat, Edit, and
            Agent modes. Knowing where this control lives is essential for the
            rest of the workshop.
          - >-
            This is the core distinction: Chat talks, Agent acts. Agent Mode has
            the ability to read your workspace, create and modify files, and run
            terminal commands — making it far more autonomous than a simple Q&A
            chat.
          - >-
            Staying in control is a key design principle of Agent Mode. Every
            file creation, edit, or deletion appears as a diff you can inspect.
            You can accept individual changes, reject them, or undo everything.
            The agent proposes; you decide.

        duration: 2
        talking_points:
          - >-
            A good Agent Mode prompt has three parts: WHAT (the deliverable),
            HOW (constraints and style), and CONTEXT (what already exists).
          - >-
            Be explicit about file structure: 'Create index.html, styles.css,
            and script.js in the project root' beats 'Make me a website.'
          - >-
            State tech constraints up front: 'Use only plain HTML, CSS, and
            vanilla JavaScript — no frameworks, no CDN imports, no build tools.'
          - >-
            Describe the visual outcome: 'A single-page landing page with a dark
            hero section, three-column features grid, testimonials, and a
            footer.'
          - >-
            Use @workspace to reference existing files — e.g., 'Read
            @workspace/brief.md for the project requirements.' This grounds the
            agent in your actual project instead of generic assumptions.
          - >-
            Longer, specific prompts produce better first results than short,
            vague ones. A detailed paragraph saves rounds of back-and-forth.
          - >-
            You can always iterate — but a clear initial prompt means fewer
            follow-ups.

        title: Prompt Agent Mode to Scaffold a Landing Page
        duration: 10
        instructions: >-
          Use Agent Mode to generate a complete static landing page from a
          single prompt.


          **Setup (1 min):**

          1. Create a new empty folder called `landing-page` and open it in VS
          Code (File → Open Folder).

          2. Create a file called `brief.md` and paste the starter code below
          into it. This gives the agent context about your project.


          **Write your prompt (2 min):**

          3. Open the Chat panel (⌃⌘I / Ctrl+Alt+I) and select **Agent** from
          the mode dropdown.

          4. Type this prompt (feel free to customize the product name):


          > Read @workspace/brief.md for the project brief. Create a single-page
          landing page with index.html, styles.css, and script.js. Include a
          sticky nav bar, a dark hero section with a CTA button, a three-column
          features grid, two testimonial quotes, and a footer with social links.
          Use only plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS — no frameworks, no CDN
          links, no build tools. Make it mobile-responsive with a hamburger menu
          on small screens.


          5. Press Enter and watch the agent propose files.


          **Review the diffs (4 min):**

          6. For each file the agent creates, review the diff:
             - Does `index.html` use semantic HTML5 elements?
             - Does `styles.css` avoid any `@import` of external stylesheets?
             - Does `script.js` use only vanilla JS (no `require`, no `import` of packages)?
          7. Click **Accept** on files that look correct. Click **Discard** on
          any file that violates your constraints.

          8. If you discarded a file, send a follow-up prompt: 'Regenerate
          styles.css without any external imports.'


          **Test in the browser (3 min):**

          9. Open `index.html` in your browser (right-click → Open with Live
          Server, or double-click the file).

          10. Check: Does the page render? Do nav links smooth-scroll? Does the
          hamburger menu work at narrow widths?

          11. If something is broken, paste the browser console error into the
          Chat panel as a follow-up prompt.

        duration: 3
        instructions: >-
          Practice the iterative workflow by asking Agent Mode to add a new
          feature to the landing page you built in Module 2.


          1. Open the Chat panel (⌃⌘I / Ctrl+Alt+I) with **Agent** mode
          selected. Your previous conversation should still be visible — the
          agent remembers context from earlier turns.

          2. Pick **one** of these follow-up prompts (or write your own):
             - "Add a dark/light theme toggle button in the navbar. Store the user's preference in localStorage so it persists on reload. Use only CSS custom properties and vanilla JS."
             - "Add a 'Back to Top' button that appears when the user scrolls past the hero section. Use vanilla JS and CSS only — no libraries."
          3. Press Enter and let the agent propose changes.

          4. Review the diffs:
             - Does the agent modify existing files or create new ones?
             - Are the changes scoped to the feature you asked for, or did the agent touch unrelated code?
          5. Accept the changes, refresh your browser, and verify the feature
          works.

          6. If it doesn't work, describe the bug as a follow-up prompt — e.g.,
          "The toggle button doesn't switch colors. The CSS variables aren't
          being updated."
        starter_code: >-
          /* No new starter code needed — continue with the landing page from
          Module 2. */

            You don't need to start a new chat session — type your follow-up
            prompt in the same conversation so the agent has context from
            earlier.
          - >-
            Be specific about constraints in your follow-up too: remind the
            agent 'vanilla JS only, no libraries.'
          - >-
            If the agent modifies code you already accepted and breaks
            something, you can Undo (⌘Z / Ctrl+Z) to revert and re-prompt with
            more guidance.

        questions:
          - >-
            Name two things you should include in an Agent Mode prompt to get
            better results.
          - >-
            After the agent proposes file changes, what should you do before
            accepting them?
          - >-
            How do you give the agent context about files that already exist in
            your project?
        expected_answers:
          - >-
            Include specific constraints (e.g., 'vanilla JS only, no
            frameworks') and a clear description of the desired output (e.g.,
            file names, visual layout, required sections).
          - >-
            Review each diff to verify correctness: check that the code matches
            your constraints, uses no unwanted dependencies, and follows the
            structure you asked for.
          - >-
            Use @workspace references in your prompt — e.g., @workspace/brief.md
            or @workspace/styles.css — so the agent reads those files before
            generating code.
        explanations:
          - >-
            Agent Mode performs best when you remove ambiguity. Explicit
            constraints prevent the agent from making assumptions (like
            importing a CSS framework), and a clear deliverable description
            gives it a concrete target. Think of it like giving instructions to
            a new teammate — the more context, the better the first draft.
          - >-
            Agent Mode is a productivity tool, not an autopilot. Every proposed
            change is a diff you should inspect — just like reviewing a pull
            request. Check for unwanted dependencies, incorrect logic, and
            accessibility issues before clicking Accept. This habit protects
            your codebase and helps you learn what the agent does well vs. where
            it needs guidance.
          - >-
            The @workspace reference is the key mechanism for grounding. Without
            it, the agent generates code based on generic patterns. With it, the
            agent reads your actual files and tailors its output — matching your
            existing variable names, style conventions, and project structure.
