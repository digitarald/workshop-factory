# Build a Landing Page with VS Code Agent Mode

Learn how to use GitHub Copilot's Agent Mode in VS Code to scaffold, iterate, and refine a complete static landing page — all from natural-language prompts. In 30 minutes you'll go from an empty folder to a mobile-responsive site with a hero section, features grid, testimonials, and more, without leaving your editor.

## What You'll Learn

- Find and activate Agent Mode in the VS Code Chat panel
- Understand how Agent Mode differs from Chat and Inline Chat
- Write effective prompts that produce complete, multi-file output
- Use `@workspace` references to ground the agent in your project files
- Review, accept, or reject AI-proposed file changes
- Iterate on a generated page with follow-up prompts

## Prerequisites

- VS Code installed (latest stable release)
- GitHub Copilot subscription (Free, Pro, or Pro+)
- Basic familiarity with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Comfort navigating files and folders in VS Code
